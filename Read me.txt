In this project we aim to demonstrate Ternery Search Tree's implementation using various functions like insertion,traversal,search etc and looking at
its one of major applications which is autocomplete.

To take input:
Enter a prefix(preferably 2 letters) to search for a complete suggestion
 If entered prefix is not matching with prefix of any word present in our directory,then program needs to rerun.
 

If entered prefix is matching with prefix of any word present in our directory then
 As output,program presents a list of suggestions to complete the entered prefix.
 
 
 For more clarity please refer this example,
 for prefix "ind"we get the following suggestions
 
Enter prefix
ind
---Suggestions
indian
indiana


I hope this was helpful,in case of any confusion,Please let us know.
Thank you
